OKI Supplies Checker

Through web scraping, information is extracted from the OKI supplies monitoring panel. The script checks whether the value of each supply is equal to or less than 20 (pre-established value for replacement).

Afterwards, a .txt file is created/updated, containing only relevant information such as name/location, model, and details of supplies that need replacement.

Note: For the browser interaction to work, chromedriver.exe needs to be in the same directory as the file. Note 2: Chromedriver exclusively supports a specific version of Google Chrome. If needed, you can download a version compatible with your browser from the site: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
